# UI Annotations
To complete this practice, you must be familiar with basic CSS styling including typography and the box model. You also need to be familiar with styling anchors (hyperlinks) and the concept of UI annotations.

## Objectives
- Practice following UI annotations
- Practice styling anchors

## Tasks: Beginners
- Create UI annotations that document what the "read more" anchors should look like and how they should behave. You will need to provide annotations for all of the following states: :link, :visited, :hover, :focus, : active. You will document these annotations in the provided Miro board. 
- Accept a set of UI annotations from your assigned partner. Implement the proposed UI design. Make this implementation live on the web. You'll submit the URL on Blackboard.
- Note any assumptions you needed to make, any changes you made (and why), and anything you needed to address that wasn't noted in the annotation. You'll submit these notes on Blackboard.

## Tasks: Advanced
- Complete all of the tasks assigned to the beginners but also include a set of UI annotations for inline anchors.
